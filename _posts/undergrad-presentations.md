		Given a polynomial f(z) with complex coefficients, we can ask for which complex numbers p is the set {f(p), f(f(p)), f(f(f(p))),...} bounded, that is to ask which complex numbers have bounded forward orbit under f(z)? Alternatively we can turn the question around and ask for a fixed complex number p, for which (complex) polynomials is the forward orbit of p bounded? Finite? Periodic? These questions give Amazingly many of the tools needed to approach these questions, arose well before computers allowed us to generate images like the one above. In this series of talks we will explore some of the basic tools and results of complex dynamics - the field of math motivated by questions similar to the ones above. In particular, the lectures should roughly proceed as:
		<ul>
			<li>Lecture 1: Fatou and Julia Sets and Cycles</li>
			<li>Lecture 2: Bottcher's Theorem, Filled Julia Set, Connectedness</li>
			<li>Lecture 3: The Mandelbrot set</li>
		</ul>
		As a results of time constraints often times results presented in the lectures will be stated without proof, however, I will try to make sure to provide citations for any such results in the notes. Additionally. through out the lectures the interplay between complex dynamics and other fields like complex analysis, algebra, and number theory will be discussed. Prerequisites will be kept as few as possible, but basic familiarity with complex analysis and topology will help.

		The zero set of a polynomial equation can be quite complicated. For example, the zero set of the "nodal curve" y^2=x^3+x^2 intersects itself and the curve given by y^2=x^3 has a cusp. Both of these curves have so called singularities at the origin. We will explore how one can "remove" or resolve the singularities of a curve, like the above examples, via a process called blowing-up. Given time we will also discuss how resolving the cusp singularity of x^a=y^b is related to the continued fraction expansion of a/b.

		Algebraic geometers have long been interested in studying methods of resolving singularities of algebraic varieties. In 1964 Hironaka showed that over a field of characteristic zero, every algebraic variety is birationally equivalent to a smooth projective algebraic variety. While this in essence settled the matter of resolving singularities, at least in characteristic zero, in the roughly fifty years since there has been considerable interest in classifying singularities and explicitly describing a resolution of specific classes of singularities. 
Utilizing tools from algebraic geometry and valuation theory we provide an explicit description of the resolution of the singularities of plane curves defined by x^a=y^b in k^2 where k is a field and a and b are relatively prime integers greater than one. Additionally, we show how this resolution process is related to the continued fraction expansion of a/b. Finally, we provide a new geometric way of representing these resolutions as a diagram of nested triangles, which encapsulates the resolution process. We are hopeful that this diagram also contains other information classifying the singularities of the curve such as its log canonical threshold.

		We study the Betti tables of reducible algebraic curves with a focus on connected line arrangements and provide a general formula for computing the quadratic strand of the Betti table for line arrangements that satisfy certain hypotheses. We also give explicit formulas for the entries of the Betti tables for all curves of genus zero and one. Last, we give formulas for the graded Betti numbers for a class of curves of higher genus.

		With the rise in prominence of high dimensional data, multivariate measures of center have become very important. In this paper we focus on one multivariate measure of center - the geometric median, which is defined as the minimizer of the sum of distances to the data points. We study the quantitative robustness of the geometric median. Showing that for a non-degenerate distribution of N points, altering k points can only change the median by at most O(k/N). Taking advantage of this robustness we introduce a robust form of Principle Component Analysis (PCA), which is based on what we call the median covariance matrix. Since there are several natural matrix norms, we look at the notion of the geometric median in general Banach Spaces. We conclude by proving that the geometric median is robust in all uniformly convex Banach spaces.		</div>
