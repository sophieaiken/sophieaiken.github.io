<h3>Expository Writing</h3>
<p>For me expository writing not only includes articles on a certain topic but it also includes problem solving. I believe exposition should be an active experience both for the writer and reader. So here you will find both my musings on topics I've enjoyed thinking about and have gained an insight that I'd like to share, and also problems (with a solution sketch) that I have enjoyed immensly and which I believe are instrumental towards a better understanding of a certain topic or problem solving technique. Well, you will find them as soon as I overcome my laziness and get around to compiling them properly. </p>
