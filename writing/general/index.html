<h3>General Writing</h3>
<p>I am very passionate about communicating mathematics to a general audience, especially mathematics that one may feel has been lost to abstraction. Most of my friends are not mathematicians and are far removed from it, so one of the projects I'm currently working on is a series of articles that builds towards an invitiation to the realm of number theory and related geometry. The articles will appear here, in no particular order. I'll add details for more projects as and when I develop them.
