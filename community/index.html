	<p class="lead">"Justice. To be ever ready to admit that another person is something quite different from what we read when he is there (or when we think about him). Or rather, to read in him that he is certainly something different, perhaps something completely different from what we read in him. Every being cries out silently to be read differently.‚Äù   ~ Simone Weil</p>

<p>I believe strongly in the importance of inclusivity, diversity, and justice, and am passionate about promoting these values within the mathematics and academic communities. If you are also passionate about these topics and would like to chat, or better yet have ideas for action, please contact me!</p>

<p><b>Commitment Towards Inclusive Communities:</b>
One step necessary in the process of working towards more just communities is recognizing and aknowldging that our communities (mathematical, academic, societal) have historically been, and continue to be, places in which people from various groups are unwelcome, with this unwelcomeness being expressed through bias, discrimination, hate, and violence. In recognizing this it is important to commit to changing this situation. For me personally, I have tried to capture my commitment to this in the <a href="/community/statement">following statement</a>. </p>

<p><b>Gender Equality:</b>
An area that I am particularly passionate about fighting for gender equality for <i>all</i> gender minorities. 
I am especially devoted to, and interested in, making math and academia a less harmful place for non-binary and transgener individuals. 
Here is a collection of links to organizations/articles related to this that I think are (generally) pretty good: </a>
