<h3>Commitment Towards Inclusive Communities</h3>

<p>I recognize the importance of a diverse, inclusive, and supportive community. In accordance with these beliefs I am committed fully to the following axioms:<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Axiom 1:</b> All members of the department/university community should be treated with dignity and respect.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Axiom 2:</b> I strive to promote a supportive, inclusive, and safe environment for all students, faculty, and staff, regardless of race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, age, parental status, or any other aspect of identity.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Axiom 3:</b> Incidences of hate, bias, discrimination, or violence have no place in our department/university community, and will not be tolerated.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Axiom 4:</b> I will, to the best of my abilities, aid those facing instances of bias, discrimination, hate, or violence; directly and by helping individuals find the appropriate campus and community resources. </li>
</ul>

<p>These axioms serve as guideposts in teaching, research, outreach, and all aspects of my career/life. Moreover I am dedicated to working/partnering with other campus organizations (Multicultural Student Center, University Health Service, LGBT Campus Center, End Violence on Campus, McBurney Center, Campus Womenâ€™s Center, etc.) to promote these axioms.</p>

<p>Finally, to all members of our campus community, I would like to say:
<br>
<center><h3>I see you, I accept you, and I affirm you.</h3></center>
</p>
