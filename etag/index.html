	<p class="lead">Experimental Talks in AG - Exploring ways to virtually communicate math<p>
	
	<p>
	The recent shift from in-person to online talks provides us with an
	opportunity to explore new and interesting ways to communicate and
	learn things related to algebraic geometry. The goal of this seminar
	is to provide a space for speakers and audience members to do this
	exploration.
	<br>
	<br>
	Each speaker will be given 50 minutes to create and lead an
	environment where topics related to algebraic geometry can be
	communicated and learned. How the speaker uses their time and
	creates such an environment is entirely up to them. They may try
	mixing pre-recorded and live aspects of a talk, they might try
	leading group work, who knows, it is entirely up to the speaker. The
	only request made of speakers is that they think critically about
	new ways to best use their time to promote the communication and
	learning of math. After the 50 minutes, a short group discussion
	will be held discussing how this form of online math communication
	went, and how it might be built upon. Everyone participating is
	asked to keep in mind that this is a place for experimentation.
	<br>
	<br>
	This event is being organized by Juliette Bruce in association with the Algebraic Geometry Syndicate (AGS) discord server.
	Updates about the talks will be posted both here and on the AGS discord server. If you would like to join the AGS discord
	server please email juliette.bruce 'at' math.wisc.edu.

	In this talk, we investigate the arithmetic structure of a class
	of Calabi-Yau threefolds. These threefolds were constructed over the
	complex numbers by Hosono and Takagi as a linear section of a double
	quintic symmetroid, and have a beautiful and simple story in the
	geometry of quadrics over the rational numbers. In forthcoming work
	with Honigs, Lamarche, and Vogt, we exhibit an obstruction to weak
	approximation on these threefolds. For the "experimental" nature of
	this seminar, we will conclude by working through a demonstration in
	cocalc. Attendees are asked to make <a href="https://cocalc.com/">cocalc accounts</a> to participate fully; no prior coding
	experience necessary!

	The problem of counting elliptic curves over Q with a rational N
	isogeny can be rephrased as a question of counting rational points
	on the moduli stacks X_0(N). In this talk, I will discuss heights on
	projective varieties and a generalization to stacks of certain
	kinds, based on upcoming work of Ellenberg, Satriano and
	Zureick-Brown. We will then use this to count points on X_0(N) for
	low N.  This is joint work with Brandon Boggess.

	Compactifying moduli spaces has been a fundamental problem in
	algebraic geometry that has been richly developed in the past 50
	years. In that time, many different perspectives have been studied
	and these have resulted in many different compactifications.
	Starting from an audience discussion, we will consider the moduli
	space of plane curves of fixed degree, some potential
	compactifications, and how they fit together. Based on that
	discussion, I will mention a few of my favorite proper moduli spaces
	of plane curves, discuss their relationships, and pose some open
	questions.

	Classically, it is known that every variety is birational to a
	projective hypersurface. For curves and surfaces, this hypersurface
	can be taken to have at worst nodal and at worst ordinary
	singularities, respectively. We will prove that in arbitrary
	dimension, this hypersurface can be taken to be weakly normal, and
	for smooth projective varieties of dimension at most five, this
	hypersurface can be taken to have semi-log canonical singularities.
	These results are due to Roberts and Zaare-Nahandi and to Doherty in
	characteristic zero, respectively, and to Rankeya Datta and myself
	in positive characteristic. Attendees will be asked to do some
	concrete computations with polynomials.

	relate to/generalize each other. Then I will describe a general

	Voronoi diagrams of finite point sets partition space into regions. Each region contains all points which are
nearest to one point in the finite point set. Voronoi diagrams (and their generalizations and variations)
have been an object of interest for hundreds of years by mathematicians spanning many fields, and they
have numerous applications across the sciences. Recently, Cifuentes, Ranestad, Sturmfels, and Weinstein
defined Voronoi cells of varieties, in which the finite point set is replaced by a real algebraic variety. Each
point y on the variety has a cell of points in the ambient space corresponding to those points which are
closer to y than any other point on the variety. In this talk, we present the limiting behavior of Voronoi
diagrams of finite sets, where the finite sets are sampled from the variety and the sample size increases. In
this setting, we observe that many interesting features of the variety can be seen in a Voronoi Diagram,
including its medial axis, curvatures, normals, reach, and singularities.
