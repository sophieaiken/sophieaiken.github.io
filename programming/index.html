<p>I frequently enjoy programming, most often working in either
Macaulay2, MatLab, or HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, however, I also have (limited)
experience with Python and Sage. A few of the more substantive projects
I have worked are listed below.</p>

 <h4>SyzygyData.com - A Database for Syzygies</h4>
 <hr>
 <div class="row">
	<div class="col-xs-8">
	  <p>
	    A central open question in the study of syzygies is to describe the
		Betti table of \(\mathbb{P}^{n}\) under the degree \(d\) Veronese
		embedding. While the case when \(n=1\) is fully understood and classical
		&mdash; the minimal resolution is given by an Eagon-Northcott complex
		&mdash; in higher dimensions this problem is almost entirely open. For
		example, when \(n=2\), not only is a complete description unknown, but
		only a handful of examples have ever been computed. The
		goal of this project is to use numerical linear algebra and high
		throughput, distributed computing to systematically gather new examples
		of Betti tables of Veronese embeddings of \(\mathbb{P}^n\). This is a
		joint project with Daniel Erman, Steve Goldstein, and Jay Yang.

 <h4>VirtualResolutions - A package for Macualay2</h4>
 <hr>
 <div class="row">
	<div class="col-xs-8">
	  <p>
	   While graded minimal free resolutions are useful for studying
		quasicoherent sheaves over projective space, when working over a
		product of projective spaces or, more generally, over smooth
		projective toric varieties, graded minimal free resolutions over
		the Cox ring seem too restricted by algebraic structure that is
		in some sense unimportant geometrically. By allowing a limited
		amount of homology, virtual resolutions, first introduced by Berkesch, Erman, and Smith (see arXiv:1703.07631),
		offer a more flexible
		alternative for studying toric subvarieties when compared to
		minimal graded free resolutions.
		<br><br>
		This Macaulay2 package provides tools for constructing and studying
		virtual resolutions for products of projective spaces. In particular, it
		implements a number of the methods for constructing virtual resolutions
		for products of projective spaces as introduced by Berkesch, Erman, and
		Smith. It contains methods for constructing curves in
		\(\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^2\) as these are a natural source for
		interesting virtual resolutions. This is a joint project with Ayah Almousa, 
		Michael C. Loper, and Mahrud Sayrafi.

 <h4>SchurVeronses - A package for Macualay2</h4>
 <hr>
 <div class="row">
	<div class="col-xs-8">
	  <p>
	   Using a combination of high throughput
      high perfomance computing and sparse numerical linear algebra Daniel Erman, Steve Goldstein, and I managed
      to  compute the syzygies of \(\mathbb{P}^{2}\)under the \(d\)-uple Veronese embedding
      for a number of values of \(d\). See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03513">arxiv:1711.03513</a>.
      In addition, much of the data generated from
      these computations (graded Betti numbers, multigraded Betti numbers, 
      Schur functor decompositions, etc.) is currently available online via syzygydata.com.
      The goal of this package is to make this data more accessible and easy to 
      use by providing a way to access it via Macaulay2.

 <h4>TestIdeals - A package for Macualay2</h4>
 <hr>
 <div class="row">

	  <p>
	  TestIdeals is a package for the Macaulay2 package focused on computing test ideals and related objects useful in the study of of F-singularities. This is done
	  by constructing functions to efficently compute the Frobenious root of an ideal, as introducted in by Blickle-Mustata-Smith. This package was co-authored with
	  Erin Bela, Alberto F. Boix, Drew Ellingson, Daniel Hernandez, Zhibek Kadyrsizova, Mordechai Katzman, Mordechai Katzman, Matthew Mastroeni, Maral Mostafazadehfard, 
	  Marcus Robinson, Karl Schwede, Dan Smolkin, Pedro Teixeira, and Emily Witt.
